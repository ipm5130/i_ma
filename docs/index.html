  <li>What is Annotation work?</li>
</ul>
<p>Annotating work is when a group of people can highlight and share their thoughts on an article or a reading. 
  I believe it is a wonderful tool to speak your mind, hear others' opinions on your thoughts and even have fun like inserting videos or pictures to your annotation.</p>
