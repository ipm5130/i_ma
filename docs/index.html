        <h1>Welcome! It's nice to see you here!</h1>
        <p>My name is Iryna Malina! I am a student at Penn State the Behrend College, I am in DIGIT
            major and planning on graduating in 2024! I chose this major because I always leaned
            towards technology and arts, not a lot can say this but it might actually be my passion
            and it drives me to put in more work and commitment for this major.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Hello, this was the first time I had ever worked with HTML or created a website in
            general. As a new learner, I would say the most difficult thing for me was understanding
            how three different platforms were connected to each other, like changing things in your
            oxygen shows up on the website and the files saved on the computer, as well as
            constantly remembering to git push to really save all the changes. Another thing that
            was difficult to learn is how crucial it is to have absolute knowledge of where
            everything is located on your local computer. I think that the Penn State site was much
            easier to create due to the fact that it is much advanced and creates the code for you,
            but I would prefer GitHub because its advantage is practice. When you do the code by
            yourself you hold much more power and pride in what you have created on your own. One
            challenge on GitHub was that I do not know the code language when I wanted to write for
            example a paragraph I wasn’t sure what kind of code to use to make it a paragraph. There
            weren’t many challenges with the Penn State website because it was very much
            self-explanatory. One skill that you absolutely won’t be able to create a website is
            patience because one little problem could get you stuck in one spot for days and to find
            it you might have to go all the way back to where you started. I want to learn more code
            language,I find it so fascinating that some people can be so good at this that I want to
            be the people.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My Penn State site turned out just as pretty as this one, if have any intrest to
                visit <a>https://sites.psu.edu/ipm5130/about/</a></li>
