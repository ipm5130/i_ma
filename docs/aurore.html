                <h1>Welcome to Aurore Game</h1>
                <p>The game I chose is Aurore! It's a 3d game where you are navigating around to get to a destination. The art of a 3d character is giving an illusion of being present inside the game, as well as the power to zoom in and out to see the bigger picture of the world from all sides is playing a big role in that as well. In this game, you can go as far as you like and see as far as you like, as long as you have somewhere to land on (if you don't you die) you can go very far. I am the character that  I am controlling, I can also make this become smaller, larger, longer, or shorter but there are no other characters in the game. I can see that the character is a girl and she runs, jumps, skips, and turns left or right as I wish. What makes this character special is the white hair and interesting body with no eyes and lips, you could see that it has these neon marks on her body which are bright and sometimes change the color. I was given very few instructions on where I am going and what do I need, which was very challenging, I had to figure out how to make certain things move toward me on my own. My goal as the character of the game is to keep moving, there are no messages or interactions just keep moving. This game's world has broken concrete buildings and hills and ladders and lots of pretty clouds which is nothing out of this world except it's floating in the air. It would be amazing if in the future they could do one or two things, one is that when you fall off and it brings you back, after a few times of falling like that it feels like the game glitches and you just keep falling like you don't come back to a spot where you fell form you just come back in a free fall, two is that when the girl runs she is making very aggressive moves and it's a little disturbing. Other than these the game is really pretty and engaging.</p>
